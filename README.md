# Construction InfraSec Homelab Environment

This repository contains a secure, production-grade homelab environment managed with Docker Compose. It includes runtime security hardening using Falco for container behavior monitoring, and is ready for playbook integration with TheHive for automated incident response.

## üîí Security Hardening

### OceanHealing App (and recommended for all services)
- **No new privileges:** Prevents privilege escalation.
- **Seccomp profile:** Uses Docker's default syscall filter.
- **Capabilities dropped:** Drops all Linux capabilities.
- **Read-only filesystem:** Prevents writes except for explicitly mounted volumes.
- **Non-root user:** Runs as UID 1000 (ensure this user exists in your image).

### Falco: Runtime Behavior Analysis
- Monitors syscalls and container activity for suspicious behavior.
- Ships with a comprehensive default rule set.
- Can be extended with custom rules.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Falco Quickstart & Tuning

1. **View Falco alerts:**
   ```bash
   docker logs falco
   ```
2. **Tune rules:**
   - Copy `/etc/falco/falco_rules.yaml` from the Falco container.
   - Edit/add rules as needed (see [Falco rule docs](https://falco.org/docs/rules/)).
   - Mount your custom rules file into the container:
     ```yaml
     volumes:
       - ./falco_rules.yaml:/etc/falco/falco_rules.local.yaml:ro
     ```

### Example: Allow benign DNS lookups
```yaml
- rule: Allow benign DNS
  desc: Allow DNS lookups by containers
  condition: evt.type in ("sendto") and fd.sip.name = "8.8.8.8"
  output: "Allowed DNS lookup (container=%container.name user=%user.name)"
  priority: INFO
  enabled: true
```

## üîó Integrating Falco with TheHive (Incident Response)

1. **Configure Falco Webhook Output:**
   - Add to `command:` in `docker-compose.yml` (or use env var):
     ```yaml
     command: >
       falco --cri /host/var/run/docker.sock --webhook-url http://thehive:9005/api/alert
     ```
   - Or use [Falcosidekick](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falcosidekick) for advanced integrations.

2. **Configure TheHive to receive alerts:**
   - See [TheHive API docs](https://docs.thehive-project.org/).
   - You may need to configure an API key and adjust the webhook payload.

## üìù Operational Tips

- **Start the lab:**
  ```bash
  docker compose up -d
  ```
- **Stop the lab:**
  ```bash
  docker compose down
  ```
- **View Falco logs:**
  ```bash
  docker logs -f falco
  ```
- **Update Falco rules:**
  - Edit your custom rules file and restart the Falco container.

## üìÇ Project Structure

- `docker-compose.yml` ‚Äî Main Compose file, includes all services and security configuration.
- `README.md` ‚Äî This documentation.
- `falco_rules.yaml` ‚Äî (Optional) Custom Falco rules.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Extending Security
- Apply similar security options to all containers.
- Use AppArmor/SELinux profiles for even finer control.
- Regularly review Falco and Docker logs for anomalies.
- Integrate with SIEM or alerting systems for production use.
